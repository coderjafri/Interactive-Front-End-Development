#### The Project Brief:
##### CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD

* Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
* Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a cvs file) or sourced from an API
* Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js


### Style

For this app i picked a light theme which included fonts, colors and theming.
 I used some custom css in assets/css .
dc.css to change values of the chart styles.
I used a dark color for the body background and a lighter shade for the cards that hold the charts.
